I've decided to offer a 4-day remote training on windows vulnerability research and fuzzing, all about finding 0-days in software (user/kernel) which will explore finding vulnerabilities in hard targets, but also include sections on finding quick 0-days in time limited engagements (e.g. Red Teams).

The training will run in October 2021.
